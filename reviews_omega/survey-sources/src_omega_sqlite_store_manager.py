    - SQLiteStoreBase: DB lifecycle, schema, WAL management, configuration
    - StoreMixin: CRUD operations (store, get, delete, update, batch)
    - QueryMixin: Multi-phase query pipeline (vec, FTS, fusion, boost, rerank)
    - SearchMixin: Direct search and retrieval (text, temporal, hot cache)
    - MaintenanceMixin: Cleanup, consolidation, health, graph, entity, I/O
